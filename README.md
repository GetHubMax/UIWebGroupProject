# UIWebGroupProject

This was a group project between me, Ben Smith and Emma Selley for a year 3 UI design course
at Victoria University of Wellington. 


## Planning

All three of us planned the UI layout. 


## Coding

At the time we didn't us Github, so it's hard to work out who did what. From memory, me and Ben did the javascript, and Emma 
did the html and CSS. Emma was an art/design student doing a minor in Computer Science so its was her job to make it look pretty. 

We were unsure what we could us for the project outside of the base web stuff and the D3 JS library so we limited our code to
only rely on the clien tside, with no server side code.
